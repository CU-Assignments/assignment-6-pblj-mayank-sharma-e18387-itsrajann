## 3. Processing a Large Dataset using Streams

### Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to process a large dataset of products using streams. Perform the following operations:
- Group products by their category.
- Find the most expensive product in each category.
- Calculate the average price of all products.

### Key Concepts:
- Advanced Java Stream Operations
- Grouping and Aggregating Data using Streams
- Performance Optimization with Functional Programming

### Implementation:
- Use `Collectors.groupingBy()` to group products by category.
- Use `Collectors.maxBy()` to find the most expensive product in each category.
- Use `Collectors.averagingDouble()` to calculate the average price of all products.
